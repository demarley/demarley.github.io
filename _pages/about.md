Welcome to my personal website!

I am a senior machine learning scientist at [Intelinair](https://www.intelinair.com/).
I'm currently responsible for applying computer vision and machine learning to problems in agriculture to enable sustainable farming.

Formerly, I worked as an AI scientist at [Stats Perform](https://www.statsperform.com/artificial-intelligence/) in Chicago, IL.
At Stats Perform, I maintained and developed player tracking systems for our AutoSTATS product.
In addition, I researched new player tracking & event detection systems using graph neural networks and computer vision.  
Prior to joining Stats Perform, I was a high-energy physicist working on the CMS and ATLAS experiments at CERN as a postdoc and graduate student, respectively.
I live with my wife and our two dogs in northwest Indiana.

If you're interested, feel free to have a look at my GitHub page 
[here](https://github.com/demarley) 
where you can view some of my random projects and previous work in high-energy physics.  

For more info, please contact me via [email](mailto:daniel.edison.marley@gmail.com) or create an issue
in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/demarley/demarley.github.io).
