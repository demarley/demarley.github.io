Welcome to my personal website!

I am a computer vision engineer working at [STATS](https://www.stats.com/artificial-intelligence/) in Chicago, IL.  
Formerly, I was a high-energy physicist working on the CMS and ATLAS experiments at CERN as a postdoc and graduate student, respectively.
I live with my wife and our two dogs in NW Indiana.

If you're interested, feel free to have a look at my GitHub page 
[here](https://github.com/demarley) 
where you can view some of my random projects and previous work in high-energy physics.  

For more info, please contact me via email or create an issue
in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/demarley/demarley.github.io).
