Welcome to my personal website!

I am a computer vision engineer working at [Stats Perform](https://www.statsperform.com/artificial-intelligence/) in Chicago, IL.
I maintain and develop the player tracking system for our AutoSTATS product.
My research is directed towards developing the next generation player tracking system using graph neural networks and computer vision.  
In addition, I use graph neural networks to improve predictive modeling and further our understanding of team performance.

Formerly, I was a high-energy physicist working on the CMS and ATLAS experiments at CERN as a postdoc and graduate student, respectively.
I live with my wife and our two dogs in northwest Indiana.

If you're interested, feel free to have a look at my GitHub page 
[here](https://github.com/demarley) 
where you can view some of my random projects and previous work in high-energy physics.  

For more info, please contact me via [email](mailto:daniel.edison.marley@gmail.com) or create an issue
in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/demarley/demarley.github.io).
